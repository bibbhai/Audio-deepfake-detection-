The file called 'Main Script.ipynb' found in the compressed folder is what was used for feature extraction and processing of the audio files.
It also contains the training of the model as well as the deployment of the model on the other datasets.
To run the script you would need to download the datasets from https://www.asvspoof.org/ and https://deepfake-demo.aisec.fraunhofer.de/in_the_wild
I will not be able to provide the datasets here

There is also a python script that contains the silence removal script that has been adapted from (Chettri et al)
